INSTALLATION

1- Disable UAC if that is needed on your version of Windows OS.
2- Reboot your machine (to take changes in effect).
3- Execute install.bat (keep pressing ENTER when prompts appear)
4- Configure notepad.ini (optional)

If something fails in that install.bat (3):
* Google as to how to take ownership of notepad.exe on your version of Windows.
* Rename that notepad.exe (probably in C:\WINDOWS\System32\) to notepad2.exe.
* Put all files from this .zip (INSTALL and INSTALL.bat excluded) in:
  C:\WINDOWS\System32\
